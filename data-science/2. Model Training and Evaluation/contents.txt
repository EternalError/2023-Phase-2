1. Requirements - Python and Jupyter Notebook.
2. Recommended - Conda setup.
3. Set up - installing libraries. Use requirements.txt
4. First steps- deciding on the type of model. Regression or classification.


Now we are ready to train a model and predict the required solution. There are 60+ predictive modelling algorithms to choose from. We must understand the type of problem and solution requirement to narrow down to a select few models which we can evaluate. Our problem is a classification and regression problem. We want to identify relationship between output (Survived or not) with other variables or features (Gender, Age, Port...). 

Depending on the problem in hand, our goal is to:
1. Train and evaluate different models.
2. Choose the best performing model and finetune the parameters.
3. Evaluate the final results.

Classification:

We are also perfoming a category of machine learning which is called supervised learning as we are training our model with a given dataset. With these two criteria - Supervised Learning plus Classification and Regression, we can narrow down our choice of models to a few. These include:

Logistic Regression
KNN or k-Nearest Neighbors
Support Vector Machines
Naive Bayes classifier
Decision Tree
Random Forrest
Perceptron
Artificial neural network
RVM or Relevance Vector Machine
