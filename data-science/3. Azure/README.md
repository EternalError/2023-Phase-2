# Data Science Phase 2 Task 3

Welcome to Phase 2 Task 3! Congratulations for making it so far. Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform and service provided by Microsoft. For this task, you will learn how data scientists deploy machine learning models via the machine learning service in Microsoft's Azure.

Feel free to take a look at [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-deploy-and-where?tabs=azcli) if you're not familiar with the concept of deployment in Azure.

# Prerequisites
1. An Azure account. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) before you begin.
2. Python or Anaconda
3. ```pip install azureml-core```

## Getting Started:
Firstly, we need to setup Azure to host our machine learning model:

1. Go to [Microsoft Azure portal page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/get-started/azure-portal)

2. Look for the Machine Learning module/resource. You can easily find this by either using the search bar at the top or click the "+" button labelled "Create a resource"



3. Create the Machine Learning resource by filling in the details. 
   1. NOTE: You can name things however you want, but just make sure they make sense to your project. 
   2. NOTE: The region 



4. Click "Review + Create" and then it should take you to the deployment page. Once deployment, click "Go to Resource", which should take you to the resource page. From there, click launch studio.
